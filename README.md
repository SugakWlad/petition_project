Petition Project
=========================

Petition is my first "big" project where I implemented all my knowlenge in FullStack web development like **JS**, **nodeJS**, **CSS**, **HTML**, **PostgreSQL**, **Redis** and **DOM** so I think this is the most important part of my education becouse I understood how technologies work together.

* This is a web site where you can sign the petition against petitions.
